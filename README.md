# ArguMentor - CTRL + HACK + DEL 2024

## Inspiration
In todayâ€™s world, strong critical thinking and rhetoric abilities are essential for success, whether in academic settings or everyday life. By harnessing the power of AI, ArguMentor provides students with a tool to practice and improve their debating skills. It fosters an educational environment where users can receive constructive feedback and refine their arguments, making learning both effective and low-stress.

## What it does
ArguMentor serves as a virtual debate coach, enhancing learning in a fun and interactive way. It is an AI-powered platform designed to help students and debaters improve their argumentation skills. Users input debate statements, and the app provides a counter-argument which is automatically read aloud, helping them refine their reasoning and communication. It gives instant feedback and assigns a score based on structure, clarity, and logic. 

## How we built it
ArguMentor was mainly built using Typescript, with React and Tailwind CSS for a responsive and dynamic frontend. We used Next.js/Node.js for server-side rendering and the backend APIs. The app leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 API for argument analysis and counter-argument generation, and Whisper API for text-to-speech functionality.
